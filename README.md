## Description

This project was intended to be my final university assignment. The version of the project has 4 months of development.

In said Assignment we had 1 year (divided into two semesters) to define a product and develop a prototype to then continue it's refinement upto a working alpha. For reasons tighly related to the current pandemic and some personal issues we didn't have the time to complete the project, so we chose to begin a new one with a narrower scope.
